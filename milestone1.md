### Project Scope Statement
| Project Purpose / Business Justification |
| :---: |
| The purpose of the AeroMedic project is to help in remedying issues that may arise on the logistical side of medical supply delivery through the usage of drone technology. Not only do we hope to achieve functionality in populated urban areas, but in remote or hard to access areas as well. Through this system, access to medical supplies and patient experiences with healthcare will see great improvement. |

| Objectives |
| :---: |
| 1) Develop and implement a drone delivery system capable of both wide range delivery and reliable product transport. 2) Establish and enforce protocols for system operation, including scheduling, optimal routing, tracking, and contingencies. 3) Ensure regulatory guidelines are followed before, during, and after project completion. 4) Execute a successful pilot project in an authorized city sector. 5) Scale pilot project for large scale implementation as a finished product. |

| Deliverables List |
| :---: |
| 1) Functional Prototype  2) Finalized Procedural Plan for Drone Operations  3) Documentation Ensuring Regulatory Compliance  4) Pilot Report  5) Scalability Roadmap |

| Scope List | 
| :---: | 

The project will focus on the testing, development, and implementation of the AeroMedic drone delivery system, instituting protocols, and regulatory compliance. 

The project will not cover broader aspects outside the defined scope, including: drone component manufacturing (Work will be outsourced), and anything involving the altering of existing healthcare infrastructure.
